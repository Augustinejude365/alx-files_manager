In backend software engineering, file management refers to the processes and
systems involved in handling files on the server or in a backend environment.
This includes:
File Storage: Managing where and how files are stored, such as on local servers,
distributed file systems, or cloud storage.

File Retrieval: Handling how files are accessed and retrieved, including
implementing efficient query mechanisms and ensuring proper access controls.

File Organization: Structuring files and directories to facilitate easy access and
maintainability. This can involve naming conventions and directory hierarchies.

File Security: Implementing measures to protect files from unauthorized access
or tampering, which includes encryption, access controls, and secure file transfer
protocols.

File Versioning: Managing different versions of files to track changes over time,
often implemented through version control systems or metadata.

File Backup and Recovery: Ensuring that files are regularly backed up and can be
recovered in case of data loss or corruption.

Effective file management is crucial for maintaining the performance, security,
and reliability of backend systems.
